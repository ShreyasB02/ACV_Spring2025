# Project: Robustness and Generalization of EfficientSAM

This project systematically evaluates the robustness and applicability of **EfficientSAM**, a lightweight variant of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), focusing on its `vttiny` and `small` architectures. We investigate its performance under common image corruptions, including varying levels of **Gaussian blur** and controlled **lighting changes**. Furthermore, we assess EfficientSAM's generalization capabilities on diverse **medical imaging datasets**, specifically demonstrating its adaptability for 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of **CLAHE preprocessing** for enhancing robustness against adverse lighting and underscore the superior resilience of **point-based prompts** over box-based prompts in degraded scenarios. Ultimately, this work emphasizes the critical role of prompt design and preprocessing in improving segmentation accuracy for both real-world degraded images and specialized domains like medical imaging.
